abstract = "Previous attempts at RST-style discourse segmentation
  typically adopt features centered on a single token to predict
  whether to insert a boundary before that token. In contrast, we
  develop a discourse segmenter utilizing a set of pairing features,
  which are centered on a pair of adjacent tokens in the sentence, by
  equally taking into account the information from both
  tokens. Moreover, we propose a novel set of global features, which
  encode characteristics of the segmentation as a whole, once we have
  an initial segmentation. We show that both the pairing and global
  features are useful on their own, and their combination achieved an
  F1 of 92.6\% of identifying in-sentence discourse boundaries, which
  is a 17.8\% error-rate reduction over the state-of-the-art
  performance, approaching 95\% of human performance. In addition,
  similar improvement is observed across different classification
  frameworks."
