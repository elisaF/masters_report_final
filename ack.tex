I stand on the shoulders of giants, or in fact a \emph{community} of giants. I here make an attempt to recognize them all. 

I thank my supervisor Katrin Erk who bravely and enthusiastically embarked on this journey with me into unchartered waters well outside her areas of research. I thank my co-supervisor Jessy Li who has been helping me dive deeper into discourse even before she became a faculty member. 

I am grateful to my incredible team of mentors: Greg Durrett, Byron Wallace, Rajka Smiljanic, and Colin Bannard. They have each helped guide my research and stretch my research beyond discourse processing. 

I recognize my fellow graduate students for providing technical and emotional support, and a shared experience where we have learned and grown together: Stephen Roller, Su Wang, Eric Holgate, Alex Rosenfeld, Pengxiang Cheng, Cindy Blanco and Rachael Gilbert.

I am indebted to the National Science Foundation for awarding me a fellowship in the Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Finally, I thank my family for their unwavering support and encouragement.
